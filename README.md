🛍️ **Session-based Recommendation System for Fashion (RecSys Challenge 2022)**

This project is the implementation of session-based recommendation solutions applied to the [RecSys Challenge 2022](https://www.recsyschallenge.com/2022/), which focused on fashion recommendations using anonymized browsing sessions from [dressipi.com](https://dressipi.com/downloads/recsys-datasets/).

🗃️ **Dataset**
The dataset used is from RecSys Challenge 2022, provided by [Dressipi](https://dressipi.com/downloads/recsys-datasets/).
- Session datasets have been already splitted to train and test.
- Session purchased is recorded an item which was purchased at the end of an session.
- Item features had been labeled including item features (color, neckline, etc…)
- A session was defined interaction of anonymous user within a day

**In this project, I use Deep Learning methods:**
🧠 NARM (Neural Attentive Recommendation Machine)
🧠 Transformer-based models
🧠 BERT4Rec (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Sequential Recommendation)
Additionally, I applied data augmentation techniques during preprocessing to enhance session diversity and model generalization.

🧪 **Data Augmentation techniques**
- Noise Injection
- Redundancy Injection
- Random Swap
- Random Deletion
- Synonym Replacement
